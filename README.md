 ## Code convention and rule
 - this source follow pep8 but it dose not have coercion
 - that is recomand use pure library and framwork
    - example : use bcrypt, not user flask-bcrypt
    - because is is easy use that but learn less that use wrapping library and framwork
 - it is recommand test everything(api function and unit test) but it dose not have coercion
